# Story Structure

## Introduction to story structure
- how we organize stories
- first consider a joke
  - beginning setup
  - buildup in the middle (conflict!)
  - punchline
- what do you want the audience to know and when?
- early on in that fish movie
  - originally supposed to be flashbacks for the parents
  - wife eaten at end of movie instead of beginning
  - audience didn't know or care why father acting how he was
  - removed all flashbacks but the attack scene, moved to beginning
- so consider arrangement of elements in story structure
- and think about impact of those elements when in vs out of order

## Story spine
- remember that a story is "a series of events"
- lots happens between beginning and ending
  - the order of events is the "story structure"
  - the structure is your foundation
- dialog as wallpaper that needs to go on the right walls
- structure story as a speech
  - tell audience what you will tell them
  - then tell them that story
  - then wrap it up
- story _beats_
  - most important moments in the story
  - how would you say what happened yesterday if you only had 30 seconds?
  - do not get into details of the plot
  - ask:
    - What clear decision is the protagonist making?
    - What is the clear cause and effect? (A therefore B, not A then B)
  - realizations for characters are great examples of the second question
- avoid worrying about how things are happening
- focus on what is happening
- _story spine_ pattern popularized by Ken Adams
  1. once upon a time
  2. every day
  3. until one day
  4. because of that
  5. because of that
  6. because of that
  7. until finally
  8. and ever since then
- story spine compresses story into beats

## Activity 1
- identify beats and build story spines
- (check out Story Journal 3.1)

## Theme
- connect events in story
- ask: _what are you trying to say?_
  - moral of the story
- add to the end of the story spine: "and the moral of the story is..."
- beats coordinate to make this larger point
- why are people telling each other your story?
- deeper points: family, identity, reason for journey
  - know the protagonist's goal from the very start
  - conflict between what protagonist wants vs needs
  - figuring out protagonist's need is the theme
- starting with a theme isn't essential but becomes so before finishing
  - sometimes it's discovered in the process of shaping the story
  - but by the end of storytelling you need to know what you're saying
  - moral -> focus on what character needs

## Activity 2
- identify themes of some of your favorites and your own stories
- (see Story Journal 3.2)

## Act 1
- you've got beats, now let's separate the structure into acts
- most commonly 3-act structure
- setup for the rest of the story
- get us invested in what will follow
- Act 1:
  - once upon a time, we meet protagonist
  - every day, story setting
  - until one day, often called the _inciting incident_
  - also introduce the antagonist
    - a force, very often a villain
    - can be anything that stands in the way (like the ocean)
- essentially you're trying to place the character in the world
  - learn enough about the world to like the character
  - understand how the character works in the world
- the inciting incident
  - can introduce a conflict motivating a journey
  - at the end of the first act in most cases
  - it "pulls the rug out from under" status quo
  - catapults the protagonist forward, since protagonist now has a goal
- audience should care about and root for main character to solve problem

## Activity 3
- First Act identification
- (see Story Journal 3.3)

## Act 2
- Act 1 established setting, characters and challenges
- Act 2 sees the journey begin
  - it's "a series of progressive complications"
  - these are the "because of that..." obstacles
  - tough decision making
  - _journey_: the chain of events leading from one to another
- do not just string events together
  - character gets beat up a lot
  - things get harder and harder
  - focus on character growth (more than other acts)
  - avoid lengthy event chasing (this act often gets too long)
- challenges until character reaches fork in the road
  - will lead to _point of no return_
  - a moment of realization, for example main character sees value of another
- _low point_: at end of Act 2, everything is wrong, all is lost
  - character is failing in attempts
  - character is succeeding but frustrated
  - character realizes there is something else needed to succeed
  - forced into confrontation
  - this will lead to showing in Act 3 that they've changed permanently
  - hollow victories make good low points
- summary
  - Act 2 follows the inciting incident
  - Act 2 introduces a series of obstacles
  - fork in the road at mid point of Act 2
    - this is the middle of the story
    - choice with no return
  - Act 2 usually ends at the low point

## Activity 4
- identify and create second acts
- (see Story Journal 3.4)

## Act 3
- story heading to climax
  - this is a "final crisis"
  - moment that matters most
  - audience at edge of seats
- Act 1 and 2 had character make "wants"-driven choices
- now things are caught in a crisis
  - the character may realize needs
- _resolution_: afterwards the world calms down
- "character sacrifices their wants for their needs"
  - this is realizing the error of their ways
- character has been tested and proves they have learned
- "theme" and "moral"
  - Act 2 saw character learn what's important
  - now the character fights for what's important
- it's hard to know how well Act 1 and 2 work until you see all acts together
  - don't leave the audience unsatisfied
  - the world's problem should feel fixed
  - the personal problems should feel resolved
  - the audience should feel like they've learned something or had a takeaway
- making the resolution satisfying
  - it should be emotional
  - small moments that show what matters, like showing up for someone protagonist realized mattered
  - symbolism around people, family, emotions
- surprise endings
  - unexpected addition of an option or idea to an either/or situation
  - finding a way to resolve that feels more real and believable than expectations
- pull it all together
  - character arcs are complete
  - clear theme
  - logical end to story

## Activity 5
- describe and create third acts
- (see Story Journal 3.5)

## Advice
- work backwards from a clear, known ending
- expose yourself to lots of ideas, especially through reading books
- watch many films with a focus on animation
- some films don't focus on narrative but instead ideological feeling
- make progress from your own life that you're already invested in
  - what has allowed you to grow?
- commit to something and finish it
- understand what doesn't work, raze and rebuild
- draw your arc on the wall and shape what's happening to your character
- go have experiences yourself and learn how wide the world really is
