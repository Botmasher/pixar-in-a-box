# Story Structure

## Introduction to story structure
- how we organize stories
- first consider a joke
  - beginning setup
  - buildup in the middle (conflict!)
  - punchline
- what do you want the audience to know and when?
- early on in that fish movie
  - originally supposed to be flashbacks for the parents
  - wife eaten at end of movie instead of beginning
  - audience didn't know or care why father acting how he was
  - removed all flashbacks but the attack scene, moved to beginning
- so consider arrangement of elements in story structure
- and think about impact of those elements when in vs out of order

## Story spine
- remember that a story is "a series of events"
- lots happens between beginning and ending
  - the order of events is the "story structure"
  - the structure is your foundation
- dialog as wallpaper that needs to go on the right walls
- structure story as a speech
  - tell audience what you will tell them
  - then tell them that story
  - then wrap it up
- story _beats_
  - most important moments in the story
  - how would you say what happened yesterday if you only had 30 seconds?
  - do not get into details of the plot
  - ask:
    - What clear decision is the protagonist making?
    - What is the clear cause and effect? (A therefore B, not A then B)
  - realizations for characters are great examples of the second question
- avoid worrying about how things are happening
- focus on what is happening
- _story spine_ pattern popularized by Ken Adams
  1. once upon a time
  2. every day
  3. until one day
  4. because of that
  5. because of that
  6. because of that
  7. until finally
  8. and ever since then
- story spine compresses story into beats

- identify beats and build story spines
