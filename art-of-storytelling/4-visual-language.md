# Visual Language

## Introduction to visual language
- use "simple visual cues" like one image to share so much
- size of something in the frame implies importance
  - show character smaller and place character in a larger space
    - depending on context, can show that they are vulnerable
    - or it can show the size of their world
  - you choose what you show on screen
  - _development art_: show key moments of story, use perspective
    - a small animal can look the same size as a human from the framing
- shape tells a lot, too
  - a ball might look nonthreatening, while a rectangle can look sturdy
  - triangular, pointy imply threatening, intimidating
- color can guide eyes
  - value (darkness) can really make something stand out
- size and shape can do work for the audience
  - get close and make character bigger in frame when they're the emotional focus
  - who is the strongest character in this moment?
- imagine how much and what you can communicate with visual language

## Line
- composition: organization of visuals in scene
  - line, shape, space, tone, movement, color
  - convey meaning and express emotions
- art and story departments come together here
  - fields
    - story art
    - character art
    - production design
  - tools / stages
    - storyboard: quick drawings sketching out story
      - put together storyboards before doing computer graphics
    - beatboard: visualize key moments at critical story points
    - concept art: key moments but polished, full color
      - show how light and color will look in the scene
    - final frame: visual snapshot of how it comes together in the film
- composition
  - visual space to expand or contract focus and center visual gaze
  - character eyes make you focus on a character's gaze
- line qualities
  - change direction: where does it point?
  - change weight: thick or thin?
  - change shape
  - change pressure when drawing
  - change length
- line meaning
  - use quality to express meaning
  - example: nervous lines are jittery and thin
  - example: angry lines are thick, fast and double back on themselves
  - example: calm lines are long and have small, gentle curves
- complexity of lines in scenes
  - consider how lines run through a scene
  - vibrating lines for energy around windowsil in a final frame
  - doubled-up, hariy lines in beatboard frame for scattered movement
  - hair lines atop a character make them feel wild, less containable
- assignment: use lines and move them around to visualize character traits
- these penstrokes bring life and emotion into your world

## Activity 1
- think about line direction, weight, shape, pressure
- be expressive, not careful
