# Visual Language

## Introduction to visual language
- use "simple visual cues" like one image to share so much
- size of something in the frame implies importance
  - show character smaller and place character in a larger space
    - depending on context, can show that they are vulnerable
    - or it can show the size of their world
  - you choose what you show on screen
  - _development art_: show key moments of story, use perspective
    - a small animal can look the same size as a human from the framing
- shape tells a lot, too
  - a ball might look nonthreatening, while a rectangle can look sturdy
  - triangular, pointy imply threatening, intimidating
- color can guide eyes
  - value (darkness) can really make something stand out
- size and shape can do work for the audience
  - get close and make character bigger in frame when they're the emotional focus
  - who is the strongest character in this moment?
- imagine how much and what you can communicate with visual language
