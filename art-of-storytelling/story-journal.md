# Story Journal

## Activity 1.1: Expressing memories
Part A:
(I'm thinking of the memory I'll share in Part C.)

Part B:
It's a complicated memory, combining joy and fear with a streak of disgust.

Part C:
One summer afternoon back in my high school days, I was upstairs in my old room, stretched out on the floor, head propped up, paper in front of me, pencil in hand, sketching away. Outside I could hear a bunch of my neighborhood friends playing. Eventually they started calling up to my window. I ignored their voices. They knocked on the door and now my parents were pushing me to go outside and play, too. I kept waving them all off. See, I had been suffering from a combination of acne plus some bad skin allergies that left deep scars all over my face, and I found it uncomfortably taxing to face other people at the time, even close friends. But, even with that anxiety, all of their uncomplicated care for me left me with a warm memory of love and community I still feel when I remember that day.

## Activity 1.2: Your three favorite films
Part A:
1. 7 Samurai
2. Fresh Prince (or Anchorman if we can't opt for a series)
3. Moana
4. (Honorable mentions: Spanish Prisoner and Death Note)

Part B:
1. gripping heroic underdog story with the weight of history behind it
2. fish-out-of-water comedy that's silly but warm and memorable from my earlier years with friends
3. beautifully realized world and reconnection to the past full of heart and discovery
4. subdued, thoughty but still kind of silly suspense that reminds me of old movies with family

Part C:
All have clear background stories that play a strong role in setting up situations throughout, they have multiple twists and sidestories, yet they focus on establishing compelling/memorable characters over weaving a complex narrative. They don't have one-off twists or plot-heavy suspense that make it less rewatchable for me in multiple viewings (with the exception of my honorable mentions). Above all for me, they were stories shared with close friends and family at some point in my life, that defined my personal relationship with film and with people.

## Activity 1.3
Part A:
1. What if a feudal village couldn't pay debts and convinced wandering warriors to protect them?
2. What if a scrappy East Coast kid got in trouble and was sent to live with his wealthy West Coast uncle?
3. What if there was an island people were not allowed to leave, but the land and crops turned bad?
	- (... and a restless young ali'i who discovered they owed their culture to ocean navigators)
4. one for each of my honorable mentions:
	- What if an average guy goes on vacation but gets ensnared in a deep multinational conspiracy?
	- What if a smart high school kid finds a notebook that lets you kill anyone just by inking their name onto a page?

Part B:
1. What if coral became sentient and put humans on trial?
2. What if history started going backwards slowly and only you (an archivist) noticed it?
3. What if a tree has been growing for centuries and now a border chops it in half?
4. What if a magic piggy bank brought back to life any figure who's head is on a coin that's dropped in?
5. What if a young girl suddenly sees the animals she's eaten come back to life, and has to deal with it with friends and family?
6. What if a smart but struggling college dropout starts getting top-secret text messages from world leaders?

## Activity 1.4
Part A:
For stories mentioned above, identify: main characters, character you connect with, worlds
1. Samurai and villagers, the funny brash non-samurai, in one town
2. the prince + family + butler, the star but esp interactions with preppy cousin, in one fancy house
3. ali'i + traveling companions, hero but specifically in moments of connecting with past, an island + surrounding ocean but other embedded mythic worlds

Part B:
Mix up the characters and worlds. What happens?
1. An ali'i and her traveling companions try to protect a small village, venturing out for help from the gods
2. Wandering samurai end up living in a fancy West Coast house
3. the fresh prince got on the wrong one-way flight, ends up on a dying island and has to help
The results are mostly comical, with interesting conflicts apparent, except the first. It's more serious and may already be an anime.

Part C:
Imagine a character and world from a favorite what-if from the answers to 1.3.
The history-starts-going-backwards story calls for a nerdy archivist who's spent life arguing for digital preservation. She's suddenly thrust into a situation she slowly realizes calls for her unique skills. The character's world feels like a small city, small enough to score a job as the familiar face in a local library but big enough to be forgettable. Scenes establish this is happening around the globe.

Part D:
What would life be like in the world from part C?
I think it would feel dull and mundane at first, and for everyone living it day to day. For the character (or characters?) who realize what's going on, it feels like a revelation, maybe followed by a dose of futility.

## Activity 2.0: Elevator Test
Step 1: Character from your favorite films
The Fresh Prince would not notice it at first, then look around, fake playing it cool. (I'm aright, 's aright.) Depending who's trapped with him, he starts escalating and making the situation worse. Then at some point he totally freaks out and lets out his signature scream. Once he's free, he totally plays it off like he was a strong survivor and whoever was in there with him actually flipped out.

Step 2: Character you are creating
The archivist gets quiet. Not out of fear. She's industrious. She looks around to collect evidence of what's going on. Other people are getting nervous, but she's alert. She tells a couple sarcastic jokes to lighten the mood, but this actually aggravates one of the fearful members in the party. The situation gets really tense, but by the end, she's found a way out.

## Activity 2.1: Internal vs External
Part A: main characters
1. funny prince
2. girl ali'i
3. smart high school student

Part B: external features
1. bright clothes, wide range of frequency in voice, hi-top fade, big smile
2. long hair, active hands, wide eyes, comes with a companion
3. sharp eyes, hunched over desk, pen, friendly chatter, long pauses

Part C: internal features
1. funny, silly, heartwarming, charming, accepting, not quite fitting in
2. curious, adventurous, determined, loyal, conflicted
3. intelligent, logical, one step ahead, dismissive, certain, superior

Part D: features of someone you know
external: cuddly short fur, beady eyes, beanbag body, lost nose, side hole
internal: anger at humanity, desire to consume, strong sense of justice, tribalism

Part E: one of your characters you're developing
external:
- human
- wearing kind of plain antique clothes, shades of dust and sepia
- moves cautiously but deliberately
- first thing you'd notice would be the backpack and glasses
internal:
- likes trying unfamiliar cuisines, new technology for function not form, close friends, cats
- fears clocks, own past, mean people getting the upper hand
- emotion most often felt is a combination of joy + disgust
- if trapped in an elevator, assessing, problem solving and snarky comments would ensue

## Activity 2.2: Wants vs Needs
Part A: wants and needs of your favorite characters
1. wants: to be popular, liked, funny and a star, needs: to fit in and mature
2. wants: to explore, needs: to care for people
3. wants: to control people, ? needs: some amount of validation, some sense of accomplishment

Part B: your wants and needs
- I'll have to come back to this but here's a first sketch...
- wants: uncover and explore adventurous problems, needs: companionship and support, to eat

Part C: wants and needs of a character you're developing
- I'll also have to revisit this but I'll throw a couple out
- what they want the most: to make the world realize it needs to save precious data from falling into decay
- what they want to become: a top name recognized in their field
- what do they need to succeed: help from other people (all oblivious to what's going on)

## Activity 2.3: Obstacles
Part A: back to the three favorites
- obstacle: social restrictions of a buttoned-up, upper-crust society
- obstacle: can't sail
- obstacle: bright detective making smart guesses at causes of bizarre effects

Part B: in your own life
- obstacle: ear pain when flying
- prevented: travel, language immersion, opportunity for growth in at least one job

Part C: character you're developing
- obstacle 1: own fear of being judged
- obstacle 2: ignorance of the people around them
- obstacle 3: missing critical piece of evidence for figuring out or convincing someone else

## Activity 2.4: Character Arc
Part A: what three favorites want at start but need at the end
1. wanted: to goof off, finds out that needs: family and maturity
2. wanted: to sail away, finds out that needs: community, land, tradition
3. wanted: to rid the world of injustice, finds out that needs: to win the game of wits

Part B: your own changes
- wanted: to consume experiences of the world, finds out that needs: to connect with people and create worthwhile things that let me do that

Part C: character you're developing
- wants at the beginning: to have the best career possible in field
- needs at the end: the help and knowledge of people they'd never have cared about

## Activity 2.5: Stakes
Part A: main characters from three favorites
- choice: stay cool or grow up, stakes: own future, type: internal
- choice: stay or leave, stakes: save island and people, type: external (+ philosophical?)
- choice: cooperate or hide, stakes: getting caught, type: philosophical

Part B: tough one in your life
- choice: stay in conventional job vs pursue building interests, stakes: livelihood, type: external

Part C: stakes for obstacle identified for the character you're developing
- choice: keep quiet about what's going on and use for own progress vs help solve problems

- girl on island, longs for sea, crowned princess to rule island, island resources go bad, have to leave to fight monster restore it, meets traveling companion, goes adventuring on the seas, finds out monster is island, restores island

- teen smart student, teen finds notebook, writes names, written names kill people, decides to rid world of injustice, detective gets onto him, teen is constantly outsmarting, ever higher tension cat-mouse logic games, they finally catch him, world is normal but uneasy

Part B: story spine game with a friend
- Once upon a time... there was a clean-shaven guy
- Every day... he got up and danced
- Until one day... he broke his tailbone
- Because of that... he grew sad he couldn't dance
- Because of that... he sought out the fabled magical elixir of the dance
- Because of that... he found out that it was a mirage
- Until finally... he learned to dance on his own a new dance
- And ever since then... people have danced the broken butt dance

Part C: story spine for your own movie
- Once upon a time...
	- ... there was an archivist who worked buried in the back of a library
- Every day...
	- ... she would collect data and work hard trying to catalog digital knowledge
- Until one day...
	- ... time moved backwards
- Because of that...
	- ... she started to notice events weren't happening in the right way
- Because of that...
	- ... she went on a hunt to figure out why
- Because of that...
	- ... she learned to lean on others and her own skills to undo terrible events
- Until finally...
	- ... she had to choose between righting past wrongs and letting history go forward
- And ever since then...
	- ... she's been more resigned to history, but stronger and more vigilant in her heroism

## Activity 3.2: Theme
Part A: three favorites
- don't lose yourself but don't avoid growing up
- listen to who you are and heed the call back to where you came from to do right by your people
- power over death goes to your head no matter how smart and just you think you are

Part B: your own life
- learned to care about making and contributing rather than taking and earning

Part C: story you're developing
- needs of main character: help from and learning how to lean on people around
- moral: there's no easy fix to history but our best shot is getting outside of our own limitations/demands/expectations, working together and changing minds
- reread the story spine with this moral
	- it works but something is off because the moral doesn't come through on some beats

## Activity 3.3: Act 1
Part A: three favorites
- choice one
	- main characters: the "prince" and his move-in family
	- where and when: in a mansion, present day (but pinnable to the 90s)
	- how we learn the type: the initial song indicates the conflict and goofiness
	- inciting incident: overall it's the fight+move, each episode it's a different way the protagonist asserts himself against his environment
	- antagonist: aunt and uncle, representing a grown-up, stuffy, wealthy world
- choice two
	- main characters: the ali'i who would be an open ocean navigator
	- where and when: once upon a time in a tropical Pacific island
	- how we learn the type: through interactions with father vs especially grandmother
	- inciting incident: first the island is rotting and then grandmother passes
	- antagonist: the fire goddess, the disease draining life from islands
- choice three
	- main characters: a high school student and a brilliant underground detective
	- where and when: a modern urban Japan, school, home, streets, police station
	- how we learn the type: when the student actually writes a name in the notebook and sees the result
	- inciting incident: seeing the results of writing a name and realizing how this could be used
	- antagonist: the two protagonists are antagonists for each other; death and injustice

Part B: your own film
- Flesh out the first three beats of the story spine with 3-4 sentences each
- Once upon a time there was an archivist who worked buried in the back of a library
	- we meet the protagonist, learning she's academic, isolated, buried in work
	- we meet the setting; it's not a typical library, but big and museum-like
	- we get a glimpse of the world; it's normal and cosmopolitan outside of that
- Every day she would collect data and work hard trying to catalog digital knowledge
	- getting a contrast between this internal world and external world
	- also between an observant protagonist and the unaware but ever-functioning external world
	- she's also doing it habitually, repetitively, systemically... not stumbled into
- Until one day time moved backwards
	- our inciting incident is some realization of time traveling backwards
	- causes are following effects, like a "bless you" before a sneeze
	- the antagonist is the march of history, but instantiated in someone who knows about it and is using it for personal gain
- the antagonist turns out is doing the same thing, but knows it's erasing history
- she realizes this and now
	- with everything she can do with everyone she's teamed up with
	- she has to decide between doing exactly what the antagonist is doing vs letting history go
- what could you do to fix history vs learning what you can do now; history lets you off the hook for being "done"

## Activity 3.4: Act 2
Part A: three favorites
- choice one
	- the want/goal at start of Act 2: recurring, but the "prince" wants to satisfy his own coolness desires
	- point of no return: recurring, but typically around school or family growth decisions
	- low point: recurring, but typically learning that his own pursuits aren't fulfilling or hurt family
	- what character learns: responsible ways to grow up without losing himself
- choice two
	- the want/goal at start of Act 2: to sail and track down the one who can help restore the island
	- point of no return: immediate, embarking across the ocean
	- low point: giving up, feeling unable to complete the journey, tossing the "heart" into the sea
	- what character learns: how to sail, and (at the end of the act) that she is not alone
- choice three
	- the want/goal at start of Act 2: to rid the world of injustice
	- point of no return: killing an innocent person tracking him
	- low point: becoming a suspect, getting captured and losing abilities
	- what character learns: his real goal is thwarting investigators and control

Part B: your own film
- want: to fix history
- low point: learning that the antagonist is doing the same thing and it's to their advantage
- point of no return: getting others in on it and actually changing an event
- Flesh out the next beats of the story spine
- Because of that...
	- she started digging into what was going on
	- she collected info about events to prove to herself and maybe others
	- she started to realize how causes and effects worked in this world
- Because of that...
	- she was prepared to share and plan to change an event
	- she needed help to put this into motion
	- she connected with others and actually shared this was going on, proving it
- Because of that...
	- they planned a change
	- the change worked
- Because of that...
	- they came into conflict with the antagonist
	- they learned the antagonist is doing the same thing

## Activity 3.5: Act 3
Part A: three favorites
- choice one
	- the crisis
		- recurring, but typically a major family issue/confrontation resulting from the prince's antics
	- the resolution
		- recurring, but typically a moment to grow personally and smooth relations
	- how protagonist showed they learned what they needed
		- often through a conversation or time/token concession
	- theme/moral
		- you can be cool, funny and unique but at some point you have to face life, family and grow
	- why the character arc was (not) emotionally satisfying
		- mostly satisfying in a simple make-up-and-say-sorry kind of way, but often ending in conversations and telling instead of showing
- choice two
	- the crisis
		- bringing the special stone to the island and facing off with the lava monster
	- the resolution
		- the monster is actually beautiful and helpful, and the world is healed
	- how protagonist showed they learned what they needed
		- a final conversation with her grandma and facing her ancestors sailing past her
	- theme/moral
		- your journey isn't just about yourself, but connects you to people and places that depend on you
	- why the character arc was (not) emotionally satisfying
		- the character still had a sense for adventure but connected to her place and her history
- choice three
	- the crisis
		- a final showdown where the detectives have him cornered but he's still sure he controls life and death
	- the resolution
		- the main character, the one using the notebook, is killed
	- how protagonist showed they learned what they needed
		- they did not, and instead showed they were unable to look beyond their own self-importance
	- theme/moral
		- you cannot selfishly take justice into your own hands and let it go to your head
	- why the character arc was (not) emotionally satisfying
		- it was satisfying in the way it handled broad themes and suspense of using the notebook and being investigated and chased
		- it was unsatisfying in that the main story revolved around an antagonist, that specific character threads were frayed and left untangled, and the best character died

Part B: your own film
- the crisis
	- an agonizing decision over whether to try and change history or to accept it and reset time
- the resolution
	- the world returns to normal, time moves forward, but the protagonist knows
- how protagonist shows they learn what they needed
	- relying on others and making that tough decision to let go of changing the past
- theme/moral
	- you live in history, you can make decisions to shift things but you have to face the past as it is
- why the character arc will (not) be emotionally satisfying
	- the emotions expected are complex and try to be epic but risk being too pensive
	- the character risks falling into a forgettable scifi arc
	- this could be instead a return to a same world that feels more beautiful and optimistic, not taking people around her for granted

## Activity 4.1: Lines
Part A: what do lines mean in [this frame](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/4798680c096a6798fbcb9bf24fb885bd21c49eb1.png)?
- how they convey emotion and meaning
	- complex gaze of characters framing the shake
	- gaze of popin character makes us part of the framing
	- lines make a portrait within a picture
	- lines inside the portrait are soft and kind of goofy fun
	- lines outside clearly frame the shake action
	- the framing characters especially the long S-curved neck and straight beak  add complication
	- the scene feels like a happy accomplishment or small celebration
- primary direction of the lines
	- dominant horizontal lines with triangle lower left
	- eye lines lead to within that triangle, including to viewer and back

Part B: a line traveling between two recent feelings
- instead of attaching artwork I'll try to describe the lines
- uncertain: light pressure, wiggly, fading to dots, picking up then pulling down
- to friendly: rolling with higher and lower hills, moderately quick, medium thick

## Activity 4.2: Shape
Part A: shapes from an example frame
- The left monster is small and round, the right one is taller and boxier, both in head and body. Both monsters have lots of circular facial elements and round props. The wall behind them is recursively squares. On that wall is a shadow with a round head but sharp angles.
- The shapes build two carable characters with distinct personalities and block out a threatening one in the middle that we can't yet see.

Part B: shapes from frames in three favorites
- the iconic shot of the prince hailing a cab in front of the Hollywood sign
	- a circle face and square body lean into the frame dominating the right
	- the cap contains more circles suggesting fun or approachability
	- the triangular lean-in and arm show movement but pull back into rounded ends
	- squares are recursively strong including in patterns but direct into the frame instead of at viewer
	- the cross-scene with triangular tops blocks out a dominating iconic background
	- combined with lines and character, triangles in background point to smiling face
- Seven Samurai shot of archer drawing bow in the rain with swords at feet
	- the frame is full of clear triangles and some duller square shapes
	- the archer has a broad rectangle across the chest but forms triangles with bow, arms, legs
	- even the front face forms a line with the torso
	- even the squares are at angles with others
	- the fire at the feet is a triangle
	- the character on the lower right is more rounded but still triangles
	- the rain softens shapes but adds straight lines
	- wow there are a lot of shapes in this scene
	- many shapes are pointing towards the archer's gaze
- when the ali'i comes face to face with and reaches out to the lava monster
	- imposing squares and triangles on left half bracing right but pointing up and left
	- gentler, smaller circles and triangles on the right side motioning up and left
	- the entire frame is clearly divided by the line from the angled left square
	- secondary shapes in the background limit gaze to below the monster's eyeline
	- circular shapes vaguely connect monster's mouth to the rock and the bottom of monster's eye to inside of wave

Part C: main shape for main characters in your own film
- the main character has slumped circular shapes with prickly triangular elements in face, hair, hands
- Their shape implies bookish, uncertain, withdrawn but curious
- The shape changes over time to become sturdier as character gains knowledge, confidence, friendship
	- standing up but also in clothing, props, figure
- Imagine the character alone among the old stacks, head over a desk, with one bulb that casts a shallow circular light on her position
```

```

## Activity 4.3: Space
Part A:
how their example image gives the illusion of depth
- the family of characters is right up front and the rest of the scene is behind them
- cars and trees get smaller in the distance
- parking lines angle towards the upper left
- characters are lower in the frame so we can see buildings and cars
- the background is slightly out of focus
- shadow, line and detail differences change between characters and the background
- characters are round while everything else is linear and pointing to tallest character

how my example image gives the illusion of depth
- Seven Samurai archer in the rain again
- the background lines aren't as clear and get lost in the rain
- it's more about the foreground characters vs background village in the rain
- there is a sense of immediacy in the space, less expansive or distant

Part B:
- mark a vanishing point x and draw squares of different sizes
- me: imagine connecting these figures to the x with lines and getting depth:
			o 			.
		0		x
			.			|-|

Part C: visual depth from your own story
- take the shape work from the last entry
- imagine the stacks on the left and right with bolder lines but out of focus
- the character in the middle is smaller, a bit higher in the frame
- the character at the desk in the middle is lighter
- the other lines in the scene point to the character (right now dead center)

## Activity 4.4: Motion
Part A: two images
- the first has two cars with strong motion lines from their upper right side
	- both cars have triangular elements pointing forwards
	- a sense of aggressive motion in the diagonals and the front car's lean
	- spoilers angled back to give a strong sense of airflow jetting over them
	- back car's eyes are trained on the first while the front looks back and side, creating immediate conflict
- the second has six sketchier ordered rat poses
	- the rat has a prominent line of action curving around looking at things
	- even though there are no other elements it's clear the rat is curious and looking around
	- head and nose are directional
	- spine and back give a clear indication of stability/pulling back/jutting ahead
	- lots of squash and stretch help convey everything from scurry to hunker down

Part B: finding motion and action lines
- an example of lines of motion on an otherwise static figure
 ||_ - _
 || - _
- lines of motion in my three choices
	- the prince hailing cab, clearly leaning over door and pointing forward
		- the arc and shape of the main character is directed screen left
		- no lines of motion added to scene
	- the ali'i girl facing the final monster
		- the main character's line of action is small and entirely visible
		- the arc heads forward but is straight upright
		- the much larger monster's arc is only partly visible but leans in
		- motion line hints suggest a clearing away from the monster and the ali'i
	- the archer samurai drawing a bow in the rain
		- the line of action is strongly up and leads back stable against the ground
		- square is stable, triangle upwards, but all action freezes at the arms
		- the lines convey potential

Part C:
- draw your character in various poses with lines of action
- draw an entire movement-heavy scene with your character
- (return to this exercise with digital pad)
