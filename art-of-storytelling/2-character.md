# Character

## Introduction to character
- heuristics
	- characters trapped in an elevator: what would they do in a crisis?
	- example of someone freaking out vs calmly assessing, helping, getting through
- entertaining characters are "deeply flawed"
	- flaws are keys to audience interest
- learning lessons, facing challenges, feeling emotions
- other exercises for detecting how audience would care and share characters' emotions

## Warm up activity
- (Check out my Story Journal 2.0)
- basically, putting characters through the Elevator Test pushes them to extreme reactions

## Internal vs external features
- getting takes from story people on how to work with characters
	- how do they develop characters?
	- go from the simple (a fish) to complex characters people love
- "fully developed" characters can be imagined in almost any situation
	- as tough as "new life from scratch"
- character development at Pixar
	1. external features: design, clothes, look
	2. internal features: security, bravery, jealousy
- how to develop internal features
	- imagine having a conversation with a friend and getting to know their likes & dislikes
	- could start from external and see what that says about internal
		- not always straightforward: contrast if they look like a hero but feel like a villain
- where to get ideas
	- authentic experiences and emotions
	- not always about you
	- who have you known?
		- it's just like someone I knew
		- it's just like what my brother used to do
	- specifics about family and friends are hard to make up
	- thinking about Up, Carl's review of life with Ellie is silent
		- artist's father was in hospital unable to speak but communicating with eyes
- what drives a character through their journey?

## Activity 1
- Internal vs external features of characters from those 3 favorite films
- (Story Journal 2.1)

## Wants vs needs
- ignore external features for now
- what's in a character's mind?
	- ask: what does _this_ character _want_?
- story tie-ins
	- if you don't know what they want, where can they go? what can they do?
	- thinking of favorite characters, what do they want to do?
	- the character is compelled to do this every moment of every day
- character does things because _wants_ drive _actions_
- learning along the way: what they want may require sharing or recognizing others
- contrast these with what character _needs_
	- harder to admit
	- things character doesn't want to do
	- good relationships
- conflicts between wants and needs
	- create well-rounded characters
	- thrust in situation that conflicts with clear goals
	- thing you value vs what you need to care for right now
 	- in that monsters movie it's progressing in career vs caring for kid
- want drives character but need is the heart people remember

## Activity 2
- understand the wants and needs of yourself, your favorite characters and new characters
- (Story Journal 2.2)

## Obstacles
- now our characters are motivated to act, but what stands in their way?
- obstacles can be external (person) or internal (fear)
	- prevents them from getting what they want
- storytelling: what is the _conflict_?
	- put characters in a tree and throw rocks at them, making life a little harder
	- fear of the ocean
	- making character break out of comfort zone
- utility: make character realize what they need to accomplish
	- fear can be immediate and make character confront scenario
- fun ones seem like car chases and villains
	- but how is this reflected inside characters?
	- how does that show shortcomings?
- how does character respond to obstacles?
	- what choices do they make?

## Activity 3
- figure out how characters face obstacles
- (Story Journal 2.3)

## Character Arc
- characters make choices in response to obstacles
- characters develop as they face obstacles
- this is a _character arc_
- character-obstacle-goal
	- obstacles make them who they are
	- character starts basic
	- ending character is better
	- but character doesn't get there without pressure
- character is a flat line without obstacles
- _climax_ is the hardest obstacle
- stories have transformation (either we watch world or character change)
	- this is compelling to watch
	- character transforms
	- _or_ character changes minimally but changes the world
- authenticity: characters need to work for it
	- often realizing they're wrong or incomplete on their own

## Activity 4
- identify character arcs for specific characters
- what does a character _want_ at the beginning but _need_ at the end?
- (Story Journal 2.4)
