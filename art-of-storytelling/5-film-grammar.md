# Film Grammar

## Introduction to film grammar
- put _shots_ together to communicate a story
  - convey meaning
  - convey emotion
  - put them together in a sequence
- parts of the process
  1. framing: change the part & perspective of the scene you see through lens
  2. staging: change the positions of characters and action
  3. motion: change the camera movement and position relative to characters and action
  4. editing: put shots together, adjust timing, add music and sfx
- the same scene can feel very different depending on these parts
  - maybe change staging to add drama and tension to the action
  - maybe change motion to convey a different emotion
    - example: an _upshot_ can make characters look "authoritative"

## Major vs Minor Beats
- before applying those tools you need to know the story you want to tell
- go back to story structure in lesson 3
  - specifically the beats in the story spine
- _major beat_: one of those main events listed in your story spine
  - often when characters learn something new leading them forward in the story
- _scene_: part of story set in one place and at one time
  - assign scenes to each major beat (one beat may have multiple)
- _sequence_: shots covering a section of story
  - not necessarily one scene; may be a montage or fast-cut sequence
- scene length: don't pack in too much story or too many ideas
  - avoid disorienting the audience with many ideas
  - avoid letting your scene grow and grow
  - what's the goal?
  - what does the character _learn_ so they can _go do_ the next thing?
- once scenes are scoped and assigned to beats, break them into smaller beats
- _minor beat_: smaller story events within a scene
- _shot_: filmmaker breakdown of scene into visual representations
  - break each minor beat into 1+ shots
  - forms: _wide_ vs _close_, _still_ vs _dynamic_
- _storyboard_: sketch representing each shot after shot breakdown is done
- draw your own storyboard by the end of this lesson
